            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Our project centers on the issue of time management and time 
                coordination. In the Who We Are survey for INST362, 57.3% of students 
                stated that time management is their hardest struggle, 28.9% said 
                group coordination, and 38.6% stated keeping up with deadlines. 
                However, time management/coordination is not just an academic issue; 
                planning a day to hangout with friends can be tough when everyone has 
                a busy college student schedule. Our project is aiming to create a 
                quick, user-friendly solution for friends, students, and teams to find 
                a common time to meet.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                People's schedules are all disconnected, so comparing schedules is 
                a hassle for most people, and even with apps like Google Calendar 
                available, the formatting of the app is not ideal for finding gaps 
                in schedules between people, so Free Time Finder will address this 
                problem by orienting its UI to be concise and easy to understand 
                for everyone comparing their schedules.
